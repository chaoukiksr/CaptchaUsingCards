Tips for Improvement
Code Organization:

Split the code into smaller, reusable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
Consider using ES6 modules to separate concerns (e.g., random number generation, DOM manipulation, event handling).
Error Handling:

Add more robust error handling, especially for DOM manipulations and user interactions.
Performance:

Optimize DOM manipulations by using DocumentFragment or batching updates to reduce reflows and repaints.
Accessibility:

Ensure the modal and other interactive elements are accessible (e.g., focus management, ARIA roles).
Styling:

Use CSS classes for styling instead of inline styles to keep the JavaScript code clean.
Code Comments:

Add comments to explain the purpose of each function and complex logic.
Testing:

Write unit tests for the functions to ensure they work as expected
